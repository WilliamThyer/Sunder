To Do
- Make 3 more stages.
- Menu Navigation for character select. Fix color change.
- Arrows for all main menu nav.
- Pause menu with arrows.
- Button remapping?
- Sounds effects for Mage (just need jump and shield?)
- Color variants for Berserker.
- Color variants for Lancer.
- Color variants for Mage.
- "Story mode".

 I want to update the controller logic so that you can also use a keyboard. Base mapping is left = a, right =d, shield = s, jump = w. Heavy=k, light=j, counter=h, dash =space.
